- For new features, create an issue first to discuss the approach
- Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it

### 2. Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### 3. Make Your Changes
- Follow our coding standards
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 4. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run integration tests
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart

# Check for linting issues
flutter analyze
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request
- Push your branch to your fork
- Create a pull request against the main branch
- Fill out the PR template completely

## Coding Standards

### Code Style
- Follow the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use `flutter format` to format your code
- Run `flutter analyze` to check for issues

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: `snake_case.dart`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Variables/Functions**: `camelCase`
- **Constants**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Widgets**: `PascalCase` ending with descriptive suffix

### Documentation
- Add dartdoc comments for public APIs
- Include examples for complex functions
- Document any non-obvious business logic

```dart
/// Calculates the total price including tax and discounts.
/// 
/// [basePrice] The original price before modifications
/// [taxRate] Tax rate as a percentage (e.g., 0.08 for 8%)
/// [discount] Discount amount to subtract
/// 
/// Returns the final price after applying tax and discount.
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final total = calculateTotal(100.0, 0.08, 10.0);
/// // Returns 98.0 (100 + 8% tax - 10 discount)
/// ```
double calculateTotal(double basePrice, double taxRate, double discount) {
  // Implementation
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: `test/unit/`
- **Widget Tests**: `test/widget/`
- **Integration Tests**: `test_driver/`

### Writing Tests
```dart
group('UserRepository', () {
  late UserRepository repository;
  late MockApiService mockApiService;

  setUp(() {
    mockApiService = MockApiService();
    repository = UserRepository(mockApiService);
  });

  test('should return user when API call is successful', () async {
    // Arrange
    when(mockApiService.getUser(any))
        .thenAnswer((_) async => mockUserData);

    // Act
    final result = await repository.getUser('123');

    // Assert
    expect(result, isA<User>());
    expect(result.id, equals('123'));
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Focus on business logic and critical paths
- Test edge cases and error conditions
